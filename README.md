# Amazon-Frontend-Clone
This project is a frontend clone inspired by the user interface of Amazon. It replicates the essential features of Amazon's homepage, including the navigation bar, search functionality, and cart display. Built using HTML, CSS this clone is a demonstration of my frontend development skills.
